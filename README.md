# Hellman Algorithm
The Hellman Algorithm is a cryptographic key exchange algorithm that allows two parties to securely exchange messages over an insecure channel. The algorithm is based on the discrete logarithm problem and involves the use of large prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

This project is an implementation of the Hellman Algorithm using Python. The program takes two prime numbers as input and generates a shared secret key that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages between two parties. The program also includes functions for generating prime numbers and calculating modular exponents.

# Usage
To use the Hellman Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the hellman_algorithm.py file.
3. Run the program by typing python hellman_algorithm.py in the terminal.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the two prime numbers and generate the shared secret key.
5. Use the shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages between two parties.
